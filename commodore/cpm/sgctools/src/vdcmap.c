set global 'vdc' prefixed vars from current vdc settings.  vdc register 28
bits 5-7 only return 0x2000, 0x6000, 0xa000 and 0xe000 on my c128d, so your
application is in charge of keeping track of the char mem address.  when
a program is first run it is set to 0x2000 which is the default cp/m value.
bit map mem size is also only set once at the start of a program.  your app
must keep track of this too.
