#Commodore                                                

I'm using [VICE 3.0](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net) on Ubuntu 16.04 x64. Of course you can use a real C64 or C128 if you convert the disk images to floppies. All of my projects include everything you need to boot, compile and run the code.
 
`sudo apt-get install vice`

Tanks versus UFO by Duane Later

![Tank versus UFO](images/tankvsufo.png)

The first programs I typed in circa 1981 were in the back of the VIC 20 manual from Duane Later. They were very primitive, but at least you could understand how basic game logic worked. The first game I bought for the VIC 20 was Blue Meanies from Outer Space. Same author, but using a redefined character set and machine language it kicked it up to the next level. That game really started me developing games using BASIC and machine language. I wrote some pretty cool stuff back then, but I was never able to recover it from tape in 2005 during my conversion project. When I looked around for Duane Later there wasn't much out there. Only that he worked at the beginning of the VIC 20 project.

If you were involved in the early days of Commodore development then you have to tip your hat to [Jim Butterfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Butterfield). His excellent memory maps, articles and books opened up Commodore's hardware to me and many others I'm sure. That was the difference between generic BASIC programs you could run on any computer and building unique Commodore programs. If you had to roll up your sleeves and write machine language for performance reasons then that's what you did. It pushed me to the next level.
