As part of my 2016 garage cleaning project I sold my C128D, 1581 and 1571 to a lady who is giving it to her son for a museum piece. I originally bought the system in 1987 and used it for several years. This got me to thinking that I should release all of my source code including some stuff I did for DOS in Borland Pascal. Back in 2005 I decided to transfer all of my Commodore floppies to disk images (d64, d71, d81, etc.) before it was too late to read them.

I'm going through and making sure everything compiles and runs, so you will get a fully working development environment for the various projects. All the compilers, etc. have been released to the public domain as far as I can tell. You will need the original hardware or an emulator to compile and execute the code. As I have time I'll add and document more projects.
* [Commodore](https://github.com/sgjava/garage/tree/master/commodore) This is a collection of APIs and programs I wrote for the C128 and C64. Digital sound recording and play back, games, graphics and other experiments.
* Turbo Pascal for DOS
* Borland Pascal and Turbo Vision
