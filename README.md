* [Commodore](https://github.com/sgjava/garage/tree/master/commodore) This is a collection of APIs and programs I wrote for the C128 and C64. Digital sound recording and play back, games, graphics and other experiments.
* Turbo Pascal for DOS
* Borland Pascal and Turbo Vision
For most of us technology guys the garage is the place for old technology (and other stuff) to die. I think the last time I used my C128D was probably 1996 (9 years after purchase). That means other than the 2005 floppy transfer project I used the C128D once in 20 years (I tested to make sure it worked in late 2016) before I finally sold it. I still had the Pentium 133 MHz Dells I used to transfer the 1571 files via MFM floppy to DOS to preserve them. I had those PCs for at least 13 years. The cool thing is that virtualization allows these old garage artifacts to live on through software and even be modified.

As part of my garage cleaning project I sold my C128D, 1581 and 1571 to a lady who is giving it to her son for a museum piece. I originally bought the system in 1987 and used it for several years. This got me to thinking that I should release all of my source code including some stuff I did for DOS in Borland Pascal and maybe even some of my Delphi stuff :) Back in 2005 I decided to transfer all of my Commodore floppies to disk images (d64, d71, d81, etc.) before it was too late to read them. I did this in the garage of course.

I'm going through and making sure everything compiles and runs, so you will get a fully working development environment for the various projects. All the compilers, etc. have been released to the public domain as far as I can tell. You will need the original hardware or an emulator to compile and execute the code. As I have time I'll add and document more projects.
