#Turbo Vision CyberTools                                                

Turbo Vision (tm) is a great object-oriented framework for building DOS applications. Unfortunately, fonts, graphics, 256 color animation, ANSI terminals, generic database browsers and other 'drop-in' tools are not included. You could spend a small fortune on commercial or Shareware libraries just to find out you bought a disjointed set of TV gizmos and gadgets in beta testing. Your DOS Real and DPMI applications need a competitive edge to be successful. Turbo Vision CyberTools gives you that edge by creating professional applications with a flexible set of tools. Powerful tools are important, but applications that show you how to use the library are equally important. All too often you get a 'powerful' commercial library with 100 line demo programs that barely scratch the surface (or gasp, have error handling). With CyberTools you get full blown applications and not empty skeleton code.

CyberFont (tm) provides fonts, graphics, PCX images, sprites, bitmap animation and DAC palettes. CyberFont is simply the fastest and easiest to use Turbo Vision graphics enhancement around. Now with new Windows (tm) look for CyberFont apps!
